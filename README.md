### proposed global variables
list of GCTs with label -> GCT object
- GCTs need to be validated to make sure rdesc and cdesc match with mat

colors in some way
- for now, maybe use a function that automatically generates colors for ALL annotations
- user can click a button to re-generate colors (essentially set new random seed)
- allow space for development of custom color selection in the future

some form of storing setup parameters
- what statistical test was run
- p-value
- etc
